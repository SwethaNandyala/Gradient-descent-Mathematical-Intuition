# Gradient-descent-Mathematical-Intuition
This is a python implementation of Gradient descent algorithm. 
The implementation of Gradient descent using python is covered.
The influence of various factors like number of iterations, tolerance and learning rate iscovered.
Different startegies like COnstant learning rate, Inverse scaling and Adaptive learning rate also covered in this notebook
